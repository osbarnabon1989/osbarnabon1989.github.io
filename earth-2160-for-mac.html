The term 1080p, for example, refers to a 1,920×<em>1,080</em> display, which translates to 1,920 pixels along the horizontal axis and 1,080 pixels along the vertical axis. Just like TVs, higher resolution displays have sharper, crisper images.</p><p>Displays continue to advance at a quick pace; currently, the most common resolutions are between 1,920×1,080 and 2,880×1,800. 4K and 5K displays take a big step beyond that, packing millions more pixels than lower-resolution displays of the same size. Apple coined the marketing term 'Retina displays' to describe these ultra-high resolutions.</p><p>A true 4K display has a resolution of 4,096×2,160 pixels, but most 4K displays you will find are actually 'Ultra HD' displays with slightly lower 3,840×2,160 resolutions -- sometimes called 2160p. 5K displays have a resolution of 5,120×2,880 pixels, or about seven times the pixel density of a 1,920×1,080 display.</p><ul><li><strong>Ultra HD:</strong> 3,840×2,160 pixels</li><li><strong>4K:</strong> 4,096×2,160 pixels</li><li><strong>5K:</strong> 5,120×2,880 pixels</li></ul><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Purchase an Ultra HD 4K (3,840×2,160) display if you want the widest selection and lowest prices. The resolution is still considered 4K-class and will be a significant step up from 1080p or 2K monitors.</p><p>Installs the Windows.

Some displays, however, have full-size DisplayPort ports that require a DisplayPort-to-Mini DisplayPort (mDP) cable -- sold on Amazon for under $10.</p><p>Most early 2011 to mid 2013 Macs use first-generation Thunderbolt, which supports <strong>DisplayPort 1.1a</strong> for a max video throughput of 8.64 Gbps. Simply put, virtually all pre-mid-2013 Macs are not powerful enough for 4K or 5K displays at a 60Hz refresh rate.</p><strong>What is a refresh rate?</strong> A display's refresh rate is the number of times per second it can redraw the entire screen, which essentially determines the display's max frames per second (FPS). A refresh rate is typically measured in Hertz (Hz), with three common frequencies: 60Hz, 30Hz and 24Hz.<p>Ideally, if you are purchasing a 4K or 5K display, you will want to ensure that you have a Mac capable of driving the monitor at 60Hz -- find your model at the end of this guide. Running an external display at 30Hz or 24Hz over Thunderbolt or HDMI can result in mouse lag and choppy performance.</p><p>Macs with Thunderbolt can support a refresh rate up to 60Hz, while HDMI can support 24Hz or 30Hz due to bandwidth limitations of the HDMI 1.4 spec. Apple has yet to release Macs with HDMI 2.0, which can drive 4K and 5K displays at up to 60Hz. More details about HDMI can be found below.</p><p>In 2013, Apple adopted <strong>Thunderbolt 2</strong>, which supports <strong>DisplayPort 1.2</strong> for a doubled max video throughput of 17.28 Gbps -- more bandwidth to push all those millions of extra pixels on 4K or 5K displays.</p><p>Macs refreshed in Late 2013 or later have Thunderbolt 2 ports, allowing for one 4K display at up to 60Hz, or in some cases multiple ones with a powerful enough graphics card. Macs with Thunderbolt 2 ports include the following models:</p><ul><li>MacBook Pro (Retina, Late 2013 and later)</li><li>Mac Pro (Late 2013)</li><li>iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014 and later)</li><li>iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, Late 2015)</li><li>iMac (27-inch, Late 2013 and later)</li><li>iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2015)</li><li>Mac mini (Late 2014)</li><li>MacBook Air (Early 2015)</li><li>MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015)</li></ul><p>In June 2015, Intel announced <strong>Thunderbolt 3</strong> with a USB Type-C connector, instead of Mini DisplayPort, and an increased 40 Gbps throughput across two channels. Thunderbolt 3 continues to be based on <strong>DisplayPort 1.2</strong>. Apple will likely release the first Skylake Macs with Thunderbolt 3 later in 2016, and those models will be able to drive up to three 4K displays at 60Hz or one 5K display at 60Hz.</p><p>For those wondering, Apple could release a 5K Thunderbolt Display alongside Skylake Macs, but it may choose to wait until Intel's processor lineup supports <strong>DisplayPort 1.3</strong>. Macs with DisplayPort 1.3, which may not launch until at least late 2016, will be able to drive a 5K display over Single-Stream Transport (SST), eliminating the need for Apple to worry about syncing two channels over Multi-Stream Transport (MST).</p><strong>What is SST and MST?</strong> In order to achieve 4K resolution at 60Hz, most early 4K displays on the market used Multi-Stream Transport (MST), a technology that stitches two halves of a display together into one large surface -- also called a 'tile' -- in software. MST, supported on Thunderbolt 2 Macs, can carry a signal for two or more monitors on a single cable, allowing for daisy chaining or hub configurations of multiple 4K monitors.<p>More recent 4K displays have started using Single-Stream Transport (SST), eliminating the need for stitching two halves of a display together in software. Instead, SST monitors feature scalers that support 4K resolution at 60 Hz over a single tile. Ideally, if you are purchasing a 4K display, you should look for one that supports SST, since MST can cause issues with in-game menus, BIOS screens and scaling.</p><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdKGJmG52Zc/hqdefault.jpg' alt='Mojave' title='Mojave'><strong>What is daisy-chaining?</strong> Thunderbolt 2 Macs can daisy-chain multiple 4K displays using one Thunderbolt cable between each, as long as they have both a DisplayPort input and a DisplayPort output. Both the Mac and all displays in the chain must support DisplayPort 1.2, except for the last display which can be DisplayPort 1.1.<p>In the image to the top right from StarTech, for example, Screen A, B and C are connected using a single DisplayPort cable between each. Screen A is then connected to the Mac, which recognizes the three as separate displays. The capabilities of the Mac's video card determines how long the daisy chain can be.</p><p>HDMI</p><p>4K displays and Ultra HD TVs can also be connected to compatible Macs with a built-in HDMI port, including select MacBook Pro, Mac Pro and Mac mini models listed below:</p><ul><li>MacBook Pro (Late 2013 and later)</li><li>iMac (27-inch, Late 2013 and later)</li><li>Mac mini (Late 2014)</li><li>Mac Pro (Late 2013)</li></ul><p>The latest Macs have <strong>HDMI 1.4</strong>, which can only drive one Ultra HD display at 30 Hz or one 4K display at 24 Hz with no mirroring.

The term 1080p, for example, refers to a 1,920×<em>1,080</em> display, which translates to 1,920 pixels along the horizontal axis and 1,080 pixels along the vertical axis. Just like TVs, higher resolution displays have sharper, crisper images.</p><p>Displays continue to advance at a quick pace; currently, the most common resolutions are between 1,920×1,080 and 2,880×1,800. 4K and 5K displays take a big step beyond that, packing millions more pixels than lower-resolution displays of the same size. Apple coined the marketing term 'Retina displays' to describe these ultra-high resolutions.</p><p>A true 4K display has a resolution of 4,096×2,160 pixels, but most 4K displays you will find are actually 'Ultra HD' displays with slightly lower 3,840×2,160 resolutions -- sometimes called 2160p. 5K displays have a resolution of 5,120×2,880 pixels, or about seven times the pixel density of a 1,920×1,080 display.</p><ul><li><strong>Ultra HD:</strong> 3,840×2,160 pixels</li><li><strong>4K:</strong> 4,096×2,160 pixels</li><li><strong>5K:</strong> 5,120×2,880 pixels</li></ul><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Purchase an Ultra HD 4K (3,840×2,160) display if you want the widest selection and lowest prices. The resolution is still considered 4K-class and will be a significant step up from 1080p or 2K monitors.</p><p>Choosing a Port: Thunderbolt vs. HDMI</p><p>4K and 5K displays can be connected to Macs using Thunderbolt or HDMI cables.</p><p>Thunderbolt</p><p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong> ports on your 2011 or later Mac support <strong>Mini DisplayPort</strong>, a common technology for connecting external displays.</p><p>Many external displays have Mini DisplayPort, meaning all you need to do is connect a Thunderbolt cable between your Mac and the monitor. Some displays, however, have full-size DisplayPort ports that require a DisplayPort-to-Mini DisplayPort (mDP) cable -- sold on Amazon for under $10.</p><p>Most early 2011 to mid 2013 Macs use first-generation Thunderbolt, which supports <strong>DisplayPort 1.1a</strong> for a max video throughput of 8.64 Gbps. Simply put, virtually all pre-mid-2013 Macs are not powerful enough for 4K or 5K displays at a 60Hz refresh rate.</p><strong>What is a refresh rate?</strong> A display's refresh rate is the number of times per second it can redraw the entire screen, which essentially determines the display's max frames per second (FPS). A refresh rate is typically measured in Hertz (Hz), with three common frequencies: 60Hz, 30Hz and 24Hz.<p>Ideally, if you are purchasing a 4K or 5K display, you will want to ensure that you have a Mac capable of driving the monitor at 60Hz -- find your model at the end of this guide. Running an external display at 30Hz or 24Hz over Thunderbolt or HDMI can result in mouse lag and choppy performance.</p><p>Macs with Thunderbolt can support a refresh rate up to 60Hz, while HDMI can support 24Hz or 30Hz due to bandwidth limitations of the HDMI 1.4 spec. Apple has yet to release Macs with HDMI 2.0, which can drive 4K and 5K displays at up to 60Hz. More details about HDMI can be found below.</p><p>In 2013, Apple adopted <strong>Thunderbolt 2</strong>, which supports <strong>DisplayPort 1.2</strong> for a doubled max video throughput of 17.28 Gbps -- more bandwidth to push all those millions of extra pixels on 4K or 5K displays.</p><p>Macs refreshed in Late 2013 or later have Thunderbolt 2 ports, allowing for one 4K display at up to 60Hz, or in some cases multiple ones with a powerful enough graphics card.
