</th><th>2020-09-17</th></tr><tr><th colspan='3'>One of the best of it's era</th><th>Time Owned: 0 to 3 months.</th></tr><tr><td colspan='4'>Recently picked up a used Heathkit SA-2040 tuner, but I cannot seem to recall where the hell I got it from. Been so busy lately with freight hauling and sometimes I just buy this stuff online and my girlfriend just receives the parcels at home, while I am out on the road doing my job.<br> This particular tuner needs to be torn down and rebuilt, because it was obviously assembled by someone with very minimal experience in electromechanical assembly and fabrication. But that is a big part of what ham radio is about…to explore and learn, by building such kits. Not all hams have worked within the engineering realm for the better parts of 20 years…as I once did.<br> The three original quarter-inch shaft couplers in MY SA-2040 tuner are made of pretty hard/heavy steel and they have only but one pinch point to clamp onto the drive shafts of the two variable capacitors and single roller inductor. I think the designers would have been better off utilizing couplers made of softer/lighter metal with TWO set screw pinch points; either 90 or 180 degrees apart. That way, they don’t need to be torqued down so tightly, in order to produce a very solid and lasting grip on the fiberglass and aluminum shafts. But buying three measly little replacement quarter-inch (6.35mm) anodized aluminum couplers is really no big deal to me. All the structural metal-to-metal hardware points in this tuner should have been assembled with serviceable thread locker, plus grounding washers used on all points of electrical continuity. The crimp lugs on the rear porcelain insulators should have been installed with the smoother sides of the crimp lugs facing the final inner clamping nut…yet someone chose to assemble it the hard way, so that the corners of the nuts are hitting the lugs when trying to turn them with a small ignition wrench. Some of the solder joints could have been flowed a bit better too. These are most of the issues that need to be corrected and I also expect to find a few more.<br> The things I am grateful for are the fact that the cabinet and all major internal components are in very good physical shape and of excellent build quality. Overall, I am very happy to have snatched this tuner up for well under $100 shipped. I have owned tuners from MFJ, Comet, Daiwa, Dentron, Drake, Kenwood, Palstar and I even built a couple of homebrewed T-network and L-network tuners, MANY years ago. I judge the build quality of this Heathkit SA-2040 to be at least just as good as the biggest and best tuners from Dentron and Palstar. Some of the OLDER MFJ FULL LEGAL LIMIT TUNERS were halfway decent with a little tweaking, but I like the major key components inside this Heathkit SA-2040 much better. I also like the fact that this is just a simple tuner with a LOT of space for internal electrical clearances (less chance of arcing) and just a long wire balun…but NO internal SWR/WATT meter or dummy load. When all that extra stuff goes quirky or even bad, it just devalues the tuner and it also makes repairs all that much more complicated. So in my view, it is better to simply utilize outboard meters and dummy loads of very good quality. Although it would be quite simple to add an antenna selector switch and a good internal dummy load, if so desired.<br> The 3-digit turns counter on the roller inductor is also of good design and if properly assembled and meshed at the bevel gear drive, it should work just as well as any Palstar tuner with a turns counter. Best bet for long term reliability of the turns counter is to use a carbide-tipped scribe or punch to pilot a small blind hole in EACH of the two involved drive shafts. Then drill them out JUST ENOUGH for the bevel gear set screw to rest and lock into place. This will keep the bevel gears from ever slipping. You may need to get a longer set screw and shape the tip on a grinder or belt sander. But once you get the set screws to lock into the blind holes or “divots”…you will never end up having a problem with gear slippage. You also need to be aware of the roller inductor end stops and avoid bumping those stops with excessive speed and/or force. If you don’t have patience, then simply don’t use a manual tuner with a roller type inductor!<br> I need not actually USE this tuner to know how well it will tune across the 3.5-30MHz HF bands, because I have owned plenty of manual tuners and I already KNOW that all the right ingredients are there in the major internal components. It really all depends upon just how well the tuner KIT has been assembled and mechanically adjusted. Meticulous assembly methods and focused attention to detail will pay off exponentially in terms of operational ease and reliability. Periodic cleaning and fine adjustment of the roller inductor is just par for the course if you plan to use a tuner with a roller type inductor. If you don’t like performing basic periodic maintenance, then don’t bother owning a roller inductor type tuner.<br> So based upon the ERA OF MANUFACTURE, excellent quality of the major internal components, sufficiently solid cabinet…and ample internal electrical clearances….I must rate this old school manual roller inductor tuner KIT with a solid 5 stars.<br> Happy DX and 73, de Scott/KB1BBY signing off… ;-)<br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><table><tbody><tr><th>N7RD</th><th>Rating: </th><th>2019-08-19</th></tr><tr><th colspan='3'>Great Tuner</th><th>Time Owned: 6 to 12 months.</th></tr><tr><td colspan='4'>I gave $200 for this one from original owner sold on internet.

The balun took some time and patience to wind correctly, but when finished it looked great.

I can't review it on 160, but everywhere else it is a champ. I think you could tune a dead cat with it. And it is definitely a beast with big heavy components.<br> Being fair, I won't compare it to the geared down capacitor drives on a Palstar, as that is hardly fair, considering this tuner's vintage and the market they went after back then. Of course, this tuner would benefit in operation from an aftermarket crank and take off the original adjsutment knob on the inductor.<br> My biggest beef with it concerns the drive shaft for the roller inductor and the gear drive for the indicator. The nut that holds the roller inductor to its drive shaft slips too easily. A better arrangement could have been used here. There was also a problem with the blind hole that allows the small setscrew that holds the bevel gear in place that drives the indicator. This setscrew is clearly supposed to just nest into this hole with no slop and not be tightened per se. It just keeps the bevel gear from slipping around the shaft and locates it properly. The blind hole in the shaft was drilled too small and would not allow the setscrew to slip into it. Therefore the orginal owner had overtightened this screw slightly and still did not have the bevel gear held in place well. So he used sealing wax to hold it in place, which worked weakly. I removed all this and simply opened the blind hole up .015' and now the setscrew drops in the correct amount and takes any strain off the plastic of the gear. Luckily, the bevel gear wasn't broken. But if you have one of these old girls, make sure that setscrew drops into the hole properly and is not just sitting on top of the metal surface of the shaft, otherwise you are risking breaking this bevel gear, which is probably pretty hard to replace. So due to the small QC problem on this shaft arrangement and so-so engineeing on the gear drive, I give it a 4.<br> Other than this mechanical QC or design issue, it is a great old tuner. It is working well in my shack.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><table><tbody><tr><th>K6RF</th><th>Rating: </th><th>2009-05-12</th></tr><tr><th colspan='3'>Excellent Tuner !</th><th>Time Owned: more than 12 months.</th></tr><tr><td colspan='4'>I just aquired my second 2040, my son taking my first one for use in his shack.

You can't go wrong, find yourself one and hang on to it. Plan on painting the top cover as most have had other gear sitting on it through the years.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><table><tbody><tr><th>W0PJH</th><th>Rating: </th><th>2009-02-01</th></tr><tr><th colspan='3'>Great Tuner Needs 1 Mod</th><th>Time Owned: 3 to 6 months.</th></tr><tr><td colspan='4'>Great tuner but has 1 flaw.The rotary inductor was built with a hotmelt or epoxy adhesive to keep the phenolic end caps in place and it is the only thing that keeps the front end cap (insert)from indexing.<br> I bought mine with the front insert loose and after review decided to improve the design by taking it all apart and adding pins in 4 places around the outside diameter into the end disk.<br> Now it is properly centered in the inductor and should never again need repair in this area.<br> A Great legal limit tuner now better than new!<br> W0PJH</td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><a href='#heathkit-sa-2040-manual-download'>Heathkit Sa 2040 Manual Download</a></li><li><a href='#heathkit-sa-2060-manual-pdf'>Heathkit Sa 2060 Manual Pdf</a></li><li><a href='#heathkit-sa-2060-manual'>Heathkit Sa 2060 Manual</a></li></ul><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S8lZ5dx9ApI/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Sa 2060a' title='Sa 2060a'><img src='https://static.kodajo.com/images/user/fileUp/864a03f0bea6e5e2b45ed8a14408882d.JPG' alt='Heathkit' title='Heathkit'><ol><li>I recently put on line a second Heath model SA-2060 antenna tuner into my station, and was reminded that several had asked me about an earlier post wherein I described the SA-2060 as having a 3 position antenna switch that performed, as follows: 1.

A factory aligned and calibrated sen- sor head insures this accuracy.</p><p>SWR indications on the reflected meter provide direct readings from 1: With a single switch you may select a dummy load, or any of three permanently-connected antennas, in- cluding a long-wire antenna.</p><p>You no hezthkit need to connect and disconnect feed lines to load your transmitter into the dummy load. With its factory-calibrated components, easy- to-read dual watt-meters, and with all its sa–2060 on the front panel, your new Deluxe Antenna Tuner will soon become an integral, indispensible component of your system. Follow the instructions carefully.</p><p>Read the en- tire step before you perform each operation. The illustrations in the Manual are called Picto- rials and Details.</p><p>Pictorials show the overall op- eration for a group of assembly steps; Details generally illustrate a single step. When you manuql directed to refer to a certain Pictorial “for the following steps,” continue using that Pictorial until you are referred to another Pictorial for another group of steps. Most kits use a separate “Illustration Booklet” that contains illustrations Pictorials, Details, etc. Keep the “Illustration Booklet” with the As- sembly Manual.</p><p>The illustrations in it are ar- ranged in Pictorial number sequence. Position all parts as shown in the Pictorials. Solder a part or a group of parts only when you are instructed to do so. Heathkit Page 5 6. Each circuit part in an electronic kit has its own component number R2 t C4, etc, – Use these numbers when you want to identify the same part in the various sections of the Sa-2600.</p><p>These numbers, which are especially useful if a part has to be replaced, appear: When you are instructed to cut something to a particular length, use the scales rulers pro- vided at the bottom of the Manual pages. Avoid eye injury when you cut off excessive lead lengths.</p><p>Hold the leads so they cannot fly toward your eyes. A good sol- der connection will form an electrical connection be- tween two parts, such as a component lead and a circuit board foil. A bad solder connection could pre- vent an otherwise well-assembled kit from operating properly.</p><h3 id='heathkit-sa-2060-manual-pdf'>Heathkit Sa 2060 Manual Pdf</h3><p>It is easy to make a good solder connection if you follow a few simple rules: Use the right type of soldering iron. Keep the soldering iron tip clean. Wipe it often on a wet sponge or cloth; then apply solder to the tip to give the entire tip a wet look. S-a2060 process is called tinning, and it will protect the tip mnaual enable you to heathkkt good connections. When solder tends to “ball” or does not stick to the tip, the tip needs to be cleaned and retinned.</p><p>Always use rosin core, radio-type solder This is the type we have supplied with the parts. The Warranty will be void and we will not service any kit in which acid core solder or paste has been used. They are usually identified by a color code and four or five color bands, where each color represents a number. These colors except for the last band, which indicates a resistor’s “tolerance” will be given in the steps in their proper order. Therefore, the following color code is given for information only.</p><p>Occasionally, a “precision” or “power” resis- tor may have the value stamped on it. Some capacitors may have their value printed in the following man- ner: First digit of capacitor’s value: To find the tolerance of the capacitor, look up this letter in the Tolerance columns.</p><p>The letter M R 1 may be used at times to signify a decimal point: Any part that is packed in an individual envelope with the part number on it should be placed back in the envelope after you identify it until all the parts are accounted for.</p><p>The key numbers correspond to the numbers on the “Parts Pictorial” in the separate “Illustration Book- let” beginning on Page 1.</p><p>To order a replacement part: Use the Parts Order Form furnished with the kit.
